                        The platform is also dockerized, allowing for containerized deployment. 
                        Dockerization provides several advantages, including simplified 
                        deployment, consistent environments across different stages of 
                        development and production, easy scalability, and efficient resource 
                        utilization. This ensures that the platform can be easily managed, 
                        updated, and scaled to meet the needs of users.
